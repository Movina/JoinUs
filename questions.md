7.passing the enumeration obj to the SequenceInputSream class's constructor
8. Using while loop,read the contents of SequenceinputStream ,and store each character into  a string object by using concatinate operator
9. Into a String array store each individual string by using obj.split(" ") method 
10. Using for loop, check whether each string with the specified String using obj 1.equals(obj 2) method
